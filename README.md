## Task 2: Implementing Perspective for Data Visualization

### Overview

In this task, we integrate JPMorgan Chase's open-source data visualization tool, Perspective, into our application. This enables real-time visualization of stock price data, enhancing the ability to analyze and interpret financial information effectively.

### Features

- **Real-Time Data Streaming**: Fetches live stock price data from a simulated server.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes Perspective to render interactive and dynamic graphs.
- **Responsive Interface**: Ensures compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system.
- **Python**: Python is required to run the data server.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/forage-jpmc-swe-task-2.git
   
Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
